# Maritime Software Suite

Welcome to the Maritime Software Suite, a collection of programs designed to facilitate and streamline various maritime operations. This repository contains several distinct programs, each serving a unique purpose in the maritime industry, from navigation and mapping to container ship management.

## Programs Overview

### Coordinate Management System (CMS) 

This program focuses on managing and working with different types of coordinate systems, including Cartesian, Polar, and Geographic. It includes features such as coordinate conversion, geographic mapping, and distance calculations using the Haversine formula. Ideal for navigation, ship tracking, and maritime location-based operations.

### Container Blueprint System (MCSP)

This program employs the prototype design pattern to create and manage variations of container ships. It allows for easy replication and customization of ship configurations, enabling efficient container ship management and design. It can be used to create different ship prototypes with varying properties and features.

## Operations Management System (MOMS)

This program serves as a factory for creating and managing various maritime operations. It uses the factory design pattern to encapsulate object creation, allowing users to create different maritime operation scenarios and objects with flexibility and scalability. It's useful for handling maritime logistics, operations, and related activities.

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you'll need Python installed on your system. No external dependencies are required for basic usage, but advanced features might necessitate additional packages. Each program has its own entry point, typically using an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block.

1. **Clone this repository** to your local system:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/maritime-software-suite.git

2. Navigate to the program directory you'd like to run, then execute the script using Python:
'''
cd maritime-software-suite
python maritime_coordinate_system.py  '''

## for the Maritime Coordinate System program
Follow the on-screen prompts (if applicable) to interact with the program.

# Usage Scenarios
## Here are some common usage scenarios for these programs:

* Navigation and Mapping: Use the Maritime Coordinate System to work with coordinates, convert between different systems, and calculate distances between geographic points.
* Container Ship Management: Utilize the Maritime Container Ship Prototype to create and manage different container ship configurations.
* Maritime Operations: Leverage the Maritime Operations Management System to create various maritime operations and manage them through a factory pattern.
